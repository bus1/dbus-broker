Subject: Activation request failed due to missing unit
Defined-By: dbus-broker

systemd failed to activate the name @DBUS_BROKER_LAUNCH_SERVICE_NAME@
because the the service @DBUS_BROKER_LAUNCH_SERVICE_UNIT@ could not be
found.

A possible reason for this is that @DBUS_BROKER_LAUNCH_SERVICE_UNIT@ is an
alias to a disabled service. This is allowed by design, to give the
administrator a way to disable name activation for a given service while
still allowing it to be installed and potentially started in other ways.

In order not to flood the logs, this message is only emitted once per name.
