Subject: Falling back to resolving auxiliary groups using NSS

Documentation: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/core/sock.c?id=28b5ba2aa0f55d80adb2624564ed2b170c19519e

In order to determine the policy to apply to a peer we need to
know the owning user as well as the users auxiliary groups.

The user and group ids are provided to us by the SO_PEERCREDS
sockopt, and on newer kernels we also get the auxiliary groups
via the SO_PEERGROUPS sockopts.

However, on older kernels where the SO_PEERGROUPS sockopt is not
available, we fall back to query the auxiliary groups over NSS.
This is racy as the auxiliary groups may change, and the groups
we end up with may not be the ones at the time the socket was
opened by the client. This is highly discouraged, and upating
to a kernel with SO_PEERGROUPS support is recommended.

The broker is shutting down after dispatching @DBUS_BROKER_METRICS_DISPATCH_COUNT@
incoming messages.

The time measurements exclude the time spent on writing and
reading data to the kernel, but includes the shutdown handling
as if the peer closing their socket counts as sending a message.
