//! # Resource Accounting
//!
//! To safely communicate across user boundaries, the broker needs to apply
//! quotas to pinned resources, so no user can exploit all resources of
//! another. This resource accounting system provides a global context to
//! assign resource limits to each user, and then track all resource charges.
//!
//! To achieve this, the system strictly separates individual users from each
//! other. Every user get a resource limit assigned, and can never exceed
//! this limit.
//!
//! While users provide the resource accounting, any active charge is performed
//! by an actor. Those always operate on behalf of a user, and then can charge
//! resources either on their own user, or on other users.
//!
//! The accounting system ensures that dynamic quotas are applied and thus
//! grant all users a fair share of the available resources. The exact
//! algorithm is not part of the API guarantee, and thus a programmatic test
//! of the resource limits is not a valid use of the API. Instead, resource
//! limits are applied similar to mandatory access control: they ensure safe
//! operation, and should only ever affect unexpected or malicious operations.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! A simple example that creates a resource system with 2 users and actors,
//! and charges resources on each.
//!
//! ```
//! use rbus::util::acct;
//! let acct = acct::Acct::new(&[1024; acct::N_SLOTS]);
//! ```

///
/// The quota-check is applied whenever a user requests resources from the
/// shared resource pool. The following information is involved in checking a
/// quota:
///
/// * `remaining`: Amount of resources that are available for allocation
/// * `n_users`: Number of users that are tracked, including the claimant user
/// * `share`: Amount of resources the claimant user has already allocated
/// * `charge`: Amount of resources that are requested by the claimant user
///
/// ## Algorithm
///
/// Ideally, every user on the system would get `1 / n_users` of the available
/// resources. This would be a fair system, where everyone gets the same share.
/// Unfortunately, we do not know the number of users that will participate
/// upfront. Hence, we use an algorithm that guarantees something that comes
/// close to this ideal.
///
/// An allocation that was granted is never revoked, nor do we reclaim any
/// resources that are actively used. Hence, the only place the algorithm is
/// applied is when an allocation is requested. There, we look at the amount
/// of resources that are still available, and then decide whether the user
/// is allowed their request. We consider every allocation of a user as a
/// `re-allocation` of their current share. That is, we pretend they release
/// their currently held resources, then request a new allocation that is the
/// size of the original request plus their previous share. This `re-allocation`
/// then has to satisfy the following inequality:
///
/// ```txt
///                       remaining + share
///     charge + share <= ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
///                           A(n_users)
/// ```
///
/// In other words, of the remaining resources, a user gets a fraction that
/// only depends on the number of users that are active. Now depending on which
/// function `A()` is chosen, a user can request more or less resources.
/// However, selection of `A()` also affects the overall guarantees that the
/// algorithm will provide.
///
/// For example, consider `A(n): 2`. That is, an allocator that always grants
/// half of the remaining resources to a user:
///
/// ```txt
///                       remaining + share
///     charge + share <= ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
///                               2
/// ```
///
/// This will ensure that resources are easily available and little reserves
/// are kept. However, for a single user, this allocation scheme can only
/// guarantee that each user gets `1 / 2^n` of the available resources. So
/// while it ensures that resources are easily available and not held back,
/// it also prevents any meaningful guarantess for a single user, and as such
/// denials of service can ensue.
///
/// If, on the other hand, you pick `A(n): n + 1`, then only a share
/// proportional to the number of currently active users is granted:
///
/// ```txt
///                       remaining + share
///     charge + share <= ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
///                          n_users + 1
/// ```
///
/// (Note that `n_users` is not the total numbers of users involved in the
/// system eventually, but merely at the given moment).
///
/// With this allocator, much bigger reserves are kept as the number of users
/// rises. Ultimately, this will guarantee that each users gets `1 / n^2` of
/// the total resources. This is already much better than the exponential
/// backoff of the previous allocator.
///
/// Now, lastly, we consider `A(n): n log(n) + n`, or more precicesly
/// `A(n): (n+1) log(n+1) + n+1`. With this allocator, resources are kept
/// even tighter, but ultimately we get a quasilinear guarantee for each user
/// with `1 / (n * log(n)^2)`. This is already pretty close to the ideal of
/// `1 / n`.
///
/// ## Hierarchy
///
/// The algorithm can be applied to a hierarchical setup by simply chaining
/// quota checks. For instance, one could first check whether a user can
/// allocate resources from a global resource pool, and then check whether a
/// claimant can allocate resources on that user. Depending on what guarantees
/// are desired on each level, different allocators can be chosen. However,
/// any hierarchical setup will also significantly reduce the guarantees, as
/// each level operates only on the guarantees of the previous level.
