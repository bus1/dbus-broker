/*
 * User Accounting
 *
 * Different users can communicate via the broker, and some resources are
 * shared between multiple users. The User object represents the UID of a
 * user, like "struct user_struct" does in the kernel. It is used to account
 * global resources, apply limits, and calculate quotas if different UIDs
 * communicate with each other.
 *
 * All dynamic resources have global per-user limits, which cannot be exceeded
 * by a user. They prevent a single user from exhausting local resources. Each
 * peer that is created is always owned by the user that initialized it. All
 * resources allocated on that peer are accounted on that pinned user.
 *
 * Since the broker allows communication across UID boundaries, any such
 * transmission of resources must be properly accounted. The broker employs
 * dynamic quotas to fairly distribute available resources. Those quotas make
 * sure that available resources of a peer cannot be exhausted by remote UIDs,
 * but are fairly divided among all communicating peers. The share granted to
 * each remote UID is between 1/n and 1/n^2 of the total amount of resources
 * available to the local UID, where n is the number of UIDs consuming a share
 * of the local UID's resources at the time of accounting.
