dbus-broker - Linux D-Bus Message Broker

ABOUT:
        The dbus-broker project is an implementation of a message bus as
        defined by the D-Bus specification. Its aim is to provide high
        performance and reliability, while keeping compatibility to the D-Bus
        reference implementation. It is exclusively written for linux systems,
        and makes use of many modern features provided by recent linux kernel
        releases.

REQUIREMENTS:
        The requirements for dbus-broker are:

            Linux kernel >= 4.14        (>=4.10 works, but lacks important
                                         security-related AF_UNIX patches)
            glibc >= 2.16
            libaudit >= 2.7             (optional)
            libselinux >= 2.5           (optional)

        Additionally, the compatibility launcher requires:

            dbus >= 1.10
            glib >= 2.50
            systemd >= 230
            expat >= 2.2

        At build-time, the following software is required:

            meson >= 0.44
            pkg-config >= 0.29
            python-docutils >= 0.13
            linux-api-headers >= 4.13

INSTALL:
        The meson build-system is used for dbus-broker. Contact upstream
        documentation for detailed help. In most situations the following
        commands are sufficient to build and install dbus-broker from source:

            $ mkdir build
            $ cd build
            $ meson setup . ..
            $ ninja
            $ ninja test
            # ninja install

        For custom configuration options see meson_options.txt.
