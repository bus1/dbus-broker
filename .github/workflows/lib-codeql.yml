#
# lib: CodeQL Analysis
#
# This is a reusable workflow that runs the CodeQL analyzer on the local
# code-base and reports defects directly on GitHub.
#

#
# NB: The actions log will show errors like:
#
#     ERROR: ld.so: object '/__t/CodeQL/2.21.4/x64/codeql/tools/linux64/${LIB}_${PLATFORM}_trace.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (cannot open shared object file): ignored.
#
#     This can be ignored. This happens because `codeql-action/init` installs
#     an LD_PRELOAD handler in a container, but the LD_PRELOAD environment
#     variable will also be set for `docker exec`. Hence, the docker execution
#     of each step will be unable to honor the LD_PRELOAD. This can be ignored
#     since CodeQL has no interest in tracing the docker execution, but only
#     the binaries _inside_ of the container.
