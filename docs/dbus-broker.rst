DESCRIPTION
===========

dbus-broker implements the message broker and bus driver of the D-Bus
specification. A controller, such as dbus-broker-launch\(1) must be responsible
for spawning and managing dbus-broker, and pass it a socket file descriptor,
on which the controller can configure the broker. The broker does not itself
read configuration files, spawn activated services, or in any other way
interact with the environment, appart from through the controller socket.
