# dbus-broker - Linux D-Bus Message Broker

The dbus-broker project is an implementation of a message bus as
defined by the D-Bus specification. Its aim is to provide high
performance and reliability, while keeping compatibility to the D-Bus
reference implementation. It is exclusively written for Linux systems,
and makes use of many modern features provided by recent linux kernel
releases.
